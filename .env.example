# INA Subgraphs Environment Variables
# This file contains all environment variables required for the project
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values

# ========================================
# Production Deployment (REQUIRED)
# ========================================

# Alchemy Deploy Key for subgraph deployment
# Get your deploy key from: https://dashboard.alchemy.com/
# This key is required to deploy your subgraph to Alchemy's hosted service
# Format: alphanumeric string (e.g., "wrlcDqLy31a4L")
DEPLOY_KEY="your_alchemy_deploy_key_here"

# ========================================
# Local Development Configuration
# ========================================
# The following variables are used for local development with Docker
# They are pre-configured in docker-compose.yml and typically don't need to be changed

# PostgreSQL Configuration (used by Graph Node)
# These are set in docker-compose.yml for local development:
# - postgres_host: postgres (Docker service name)
# - postgres_user: graph-node
# - postgres_pass: let-me-in
# - postgres_db: graph-node

# IPFS Configuration
# Default: ipfs:5001 (Docker service connection)

# Ethereum RPC Endpoint
# Default: mainnet:http://host.docker.internal:8545
# For Arbitrum Sepolia, you might want to override this in docker-compose.yml

# Graph Node Logging
# Default: info (can be set to: error, warn, info, debug, trace)

# ========================================
# Network Information (Reference)
# ========================================
# The subgraph is configured for Arbitrum Sepolia:
# - Network: arbitrum-sepolia
# - Start Block: 148053393
# - Registry Contract: 0x7594B4D86BcC2745b42b6ea2bB039c1A4A7720Db

# ========================================
# Deployment Endpoints (Reference)
# ========================================
# These are hardcoded in deploy.sh but listed here for reference:
# - Deploy URL: https://subgraphs.alchemy.com/api/subgraphs/deploy
# - IPFS URL: https://ipfs.satsuma.xyz
# - Version Label: Uses git commit hash automatically

# ========================================
# Setup Instructions
# ========================================
# 1. Copy this file: cp .env.example .env
# 2. Get your Alchemy deploy key from https://dashboard.alchemy.com/
# 3. Fill in the DEPLOY_KEY value in your .env file
# 4. For local development, use: docker-compose up
# 5. For production deployment, use: ./deploy.sh

# ========================================
# IMPORTANT NOTES
# ========================================
# - Never commit your .env file to version control
# - Keep your DEPLOY_KEY secure - it provides deployment access
# - The docker-compose.yml file contains all necessary local dev configurations
# - Make sure Docker is running before starting local development
# - Run 'graph codegen' after any schema changes
# - Run 'graph build' before deploying
